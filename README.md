## Student registration
This is where new students are registered.
Before registering the student in the database, the ID number is checked so that it is not identical to the rest of the ID numbers registered in the database. The e-mail and the telephone number are also validated, and in case of invalidity, or one of the information entered is invalid, or one of the required information has not been entered, a message indicating this is displayed.

Moreover, if the new student is registered in the database, he is added and his data is displayed in the table of the main interface of the program.
